# Welcome to my Jekyll website!

Currently, I am making this for a class at the University of Michigan where I am completing my masters degree at the School of Information.
My goal is to become a data librarian, and I hope that the skills I'm gaining and practicing in this class will help me in the future!

**Who am I?**
Great question! My name is Lindsey Rogers, currently a second year library and archives (LAKES) student who is employeed at the Law Library (where I work with a lot of metadata)
and at the Clark Library (where I also work with a lot of metadata, but this time about maps). I got really into databases this past summer while working at my internship at the Clark,
where I helped build and populate the database that manages the metadata for scanned images held by the Clark library. I am now pretty familiar with Claris Filemaker Pro! I use it everyday
at the Clark. I am also able to use Microsoft Access, and am taking an SQL class to hopefully be able to write queries for that database which would make it much easier to manage.

Okay, take 3, this time officially from my terminal to try and test this! Do we think I'll have any luck? This has been really interesting, because I have been trying to get this to work all afternoon and I still have an unbelievable amount of reading to do to understand HTML and markdown becuase I havn't meaningfully used HTML since I was 14 and copying and pasting code into my tumblr to get a sparkly cursor.
